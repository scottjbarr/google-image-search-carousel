      <p class="lead">
        Bamboos are some of the fastest-growing plants in the world, due to a
        unique rhizome-dependent system. Bamboos are of notable economic and
        cultural significance in South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia,
        being used for building materials, as a food source, and as a versatile
        raw product. High-quality bamboo is stronger than steel, a property
        that has made it a choice in building materials and weaponry.
